1. the fields of location location
   1) location_id
   2) location_group_id
   3) hardware_location_id
   4) role
   5) sm_location
   6) admin_status
   7) oper_status

2. Hardware Management Interface
   1) IPSs
      ATG_HM_START_LOCATION        SM->HM    Start an N-BASE location
                                   HM->SM    Response
      ATG_HM_STOP_LOCATION         SM->HM    Stop an N-BASE location
                                   HM->SM    Response
      ATG_HM_SET_LOCATION_INFO     SM->HM    Set information of an N-BASE location
                                   HM->SM    Response
      ATG_HM_GET_LOCATION_INFO     SM->HM    Get information of an N-BASE location
                                   HM->SM    Response
      ATG_HM_LOCATION_STATUS_IND   HM->SM    Notify SM of N-BASE location status
      ATG_HM_HARDWARE_STATUS_IND   HM->SM    Notify SM of hardware location status

3. System Manager Startup (e.g. sipamain.c)
   1) initialize N-BASE
   2) initialize N-BASE products
   3) create System Manager
   4) Spin the N-BASE scheduler

4. When System Manager is started in primary location, it can receive
   1) MIB messages from MIB stub
   2) HM messages from HM stub
   3) HAF/SM signals from the HAF Library for all FTIs
   4) Replication response from a backup SM

5. When System Manager is started in backup location, it can receive
   1) Replication request from a primary SM
   2) HM indications from HM stub

As a backup, System Manager does not create or manage any FTEs. 
Backup FTIs are always managed by the primary instance of SM.  
It does not receive any MIB requests (the MIB stub is only created when SM is running as a primary).

6. System Manager Replication 
   1) Catch-up replication
      a) primary SM sends a START_REPLICATION Request to backup SM
      b) backup SM sends a START_REPLICATION Response to primary SM
      c) primary SM sends replication signals to backup SM. (location, entity, instance and join control blocks)
      d) primary SM sends a REPLICATION_COMPLETE Request to backup SM
      e) backup SM sends a REPLICATION_COMPLETE Response to primary SM

   2) Dynamic replication
      location, entity, instance and join control block states
