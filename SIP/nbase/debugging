1. BUG info
a) 47425: (core dump after forking)
diagnostics
call back
core file
code read

b) 47551 (asserts on receipt of message)
ips trace shows the call flow
core dump shows the assert

c) 41255: good example of ips trace (invalid message sent to the wrong port)

d) 52431: no ips trace, and start with core file

e) 53718: (no data sent or received)
check PD logs and ips trace
code read to look for possible paths
anything else in sipa.out

2. Advice on encountering the problems
a) Don't be afraid to code-read
       A good editor such as EMACS or VSlick is enormously valuable
       Know where the key entry points are
       Understand the architecture
b) Reproduce issues with a debug build
c) IPS trace (with event trace) helpful in 90% of cases

3, Tools to be investigated
a) ips trace
b) reproduce issues with a debug build
   internal trace
   memory checking to catch overwrites
   memory verification to catch memory leaks
c) diagnostics
d) use memory tracking statistics to catch leaks in a production build
e) how to utilize the asserts
   if hit on packet receipt, probably a bug in DC-SIP
   if hit when application sends message, probably interface abuse
