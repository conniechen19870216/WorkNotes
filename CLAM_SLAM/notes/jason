lm_bdy1.c ==> defines all the modules

Normal flow:

1. SLAM receive input from TL1, certain SLAM fsm is called
2. In lm_bdy1.c, the TABLE_ID and TL1Key can be found. Also in IFSLAM(xxx), the xxx is the SLAM module fsm for this command.
3. In the SLAM module fsm, data would be passed to DB or CLAM accordingly.
4. SLAM will find CLAM ID for certain module, slAddClamId().
5. Data (including TABLE_ID, event) Post to CLAM, cl_ex_ms.c will handle it.
6. CLAM will read lm_bdy1.c, and determine which thread will be touched based on TABLE_ID and TL1Key.
7. The real processing entrance can be found in cl_tb_mgsig.c/cl_tb_ccs.c/...

How to find the CLAM/SLAM file through TL1 command:

0. Find the xml file for TL1
Under components directory: grep -i "ed-sg-protn" tl1/xml/*

1. Go to tl1/src/user_impl.
cd /home/yex/sandbox/BRANCH-8-0-4/TelicaRoot/components/tl1/src/user_impl

2. Grep the TL1 command ("-" -> "_").
grep "STG_SLKL3" *

3. View the file that was grepped out to get the table_id
vi agc_STG_NE_impl.c
search STG_SLKL3
Get the table id: tableId = STGMTP3LNK_TAB_ID;

4. Search "STGMTP3LNK_TAB_ID" to get the file.

5. For ED, 4 steps:
- START /* Get the TL1 input */
- DB_GET /* Retrieve info from DB */
- DB_TEST /* Merge TL1 input and DB content */
- DB_SET /* Continue to update DB and notify clam/layer */
