1. list the user-defined commands, execute the following command
   :command

2. Define a new command, User-defined commands must start with a capital letter.
   :command Yes :!source ~/.bashrc                                                                                           

   :command -nargs=+ Say :echo "<args>"

3. Arguments
zero arguments is the default, you do not need to add 
"-nargs=0".  The other values of -nargs are as follows:

   -nargs=0        No arguments
   -nargs=1        One argument
   -nargs=*        Any number of arguments
   -nargs=?        Zero or one argument
   -nargs=+        One or more arguments

4. (1) redefine the same command use the ! argument:
   :command -nargs=+ Say :echo "<args>"

   :command! -nargs=+ Say :echo <q-args>
   
   (2) To delete a user command use ":delcommand".  It takes a single argument, which
   is the name of the command.  Example: >

   :delcommand SaveIt

   To delete all the user commands: >

   :comclear


5. Others
(1) <q-args>
   :Say he said "hello"

   To get special characters turned into a string, properly escaped to use as an
   expression, use "<q-args>": >

   :command -nargs=+ Say :echo <q-args>

   Now the above ":Say" command will result in this to be executed: >

   :echo "he said \"hello\""

(2) <f-args>
	The <f-args> keyword contains the same information as the <args> keyword,
	except in a format suitable for use as function call arguments.  For example:
    :command -nargs=* DoIt :call AFunction(<f-args>)
    :DoIt a b c

	Executes the following command: 

    :call AFunction("a", "b", "c")
