Hi All,


The attachment is the help document of BIND9.
It will be very helpful if you have any questions
about BIND9.

In particular, FAQ in overview directory contains 
quite a lot of useful information you may need.

There is always a way out when you meet with 
difficulties. It is a good habit to refer to
the official help document of open source software.

I hope it will help you a lot. Come on, everybody!


Thanks,
Kavon
