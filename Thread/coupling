1. Tight coupling
Layers within a single process that share the same address space can invoke primitives (functions) in each other. 
This method of inter-layer communication is called tight coupling.

2. Loose coupling

Other layers can use a generic message-passing method of inter-layer communication called loose coupling. Layers that must use loose coupling include:

1) Layers in different processes that do not share a common address space

2) Layers that are attached to different System tasks (even if they do share the same address space)

Loose coupling can also be used between layers that do share the same address space and are attached to the same System task. 
Loose coupling between layers within the same process enables asynchronous operations.

These layers can use a generic message-passing method of inter-layer communication called loose coupling.

3. A layer is always tightly coupled with System Services.
