1. rules:
   In general, performance tuning consists of the following steps:
   (1) Define the performance problem.
   (2) Identify the bottlenecks by using monitoring and measurement tools. (This chapter focuses on measuring from the timing aspect.)
   (3) Remove bottlenecks by applying a tuning methodology.
   (4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you find a satisfactory resolution.
[key words] performance tunning, bottleneck, tunning methodology, satisfactory resolution

2. tools: 
   (1) stopwatch, date, time: no changes to the program 
   (2) clock, gettimeofday: changes to the program
   (3) gprof/kprof => please see makefile for details
       profile open source codes with gprof: make CFLAGS+=-pg LDFLAGS+=-pg
